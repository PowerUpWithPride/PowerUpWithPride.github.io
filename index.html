    <h1>What is PUWP?</h1>
    <p>Power Up With Pride: benefiting LGBTQIA+ charities, featuring LGBTQIA+ speedrunners.</p>
    <p>Founded in 2016, Power Up With Pride is a video gaming charity marathon, created by the LGBTQIA+ speedrunning community for the community at large. During our Summer and Winter Pride events, we showcase speedruns, challenge runs, and community games, with an emphasis on LGBTQIA+ and ally runners. We do this while coming together as a community to raise money for LGBTQIA+ charities, in hopes of providing a comfortable and exciting online environment for queer folks in the gaming community.</p>
    <!--<h1>Who is the Trevor Project?</h1>

    <h1 id="coc">Code of Conduct</h1>
    <p>We expect all participants to follow these rules within all Power Up With Pride events and within all official Power Up With Pride communication channels. This policy is subject to changes without notice.
    <p>Power Up With Pride is dedicated to providing an enjoyable event for everyone and expects participants at our events to act in a way that promotes an environment that is harassment-free, safe, comfortable, and enjoyable to be a part of.</p>
    <p>Our events are for everyone, regardless of that person's gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, age, religion, veteran status, socioeconomic status, or criminal record. We do not tolerate harassment of event participants in any form.</p>
    <p>You agree that when at one of our events, you will behave in a way that enables our expected environment and will not, by way of example, and not as a limitation:</p>
<ul>
<li>Engage in speech or other activity that, whether by intent or action, attacks or demeans a group of people based on gender, sexual orientation, disability, nationality, physical appearance, body size, race, age, religion, veteran status, socioeconomic status, or criminal record.</li>
<li>Abuse, harass, or threaten others.</li>
<li>Present an image or words that violate others’ right to dignity.</li>
<li>Create a false identity for the purpose of maliciously misleading others.</li>
<li>Create a sustained disruption of presentations or other events.</li>
<li>Intentionally incite others to act in the prohibited ways listed.</li>
<li>Present any content that violates Twitch terms of service.</li>
</ul>
<p>Anyone asked to stop inappropriate behavior is expected to comply at once.</p>
<p>If a participant engages in inappropriate behavior, the event organizers will take necessary action to preserve a welcoming environment for all other attendees. This is a zero-tolerance policy.</p>
<p>If someone makes you or anyone else feel unsafe or unwelcome, please report it as soon as possible by direct messaging a chat moderator or event staff as listed on the Twitch profile for Power Up With Pride.</p>
<p>When taking a report, our event staff and team will make sure you are safe and keep the incident confidential. We’ll ask you to tell us about what happened -- this can be upsetting, but we'll handle it as respectfully as possible. We may involve other event staff to make sure your report is managed properly, and we may inform chat moderators that an incident has occurred.</p>
